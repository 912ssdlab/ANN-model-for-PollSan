### 3. Data
```data_set.xlsx```: The dataset for model training. X_GC indicates whether there are pages with garbage collection. X_Wear  indicates whether there are pages with wear level.
X_Wr indicates the mormalized number of occurred write reques. X_Inv indicates the normalize number of occurred invalid page.
